# Generative AI-Driven Intelligent Apps Development

Welcome to my repository! This collection of projects is based on the Deep Learning Specialization offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/) and building real AI apps by [OpenAI Tutorials](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials). Each project corresponds to a specific course in the specialization or OpenAI tutorial.

## Projects

1. **[Web QA Embeddings](ChatGPTAPI/Web-QA-Embeddings):**
   - Web AI system that can answer questions about a website using the OpenAI Embeddings

2. **[Responding to Customer Reviews](ChatGPTAPI/Responding-to-customer-reviews):**
   - Web-based customer service assistant system designed to send email responses derived from customer reviews of electronic products. It utilizes techniques such as summarizing, inferring, transforming text, and expanding to generate effective and contextually relevant responses.

3. **[Answering Customer Questions about Electronic Store Products](ChatGPTAPI/Customer-Support-System-Q-and-A):**
   - A web-based customer support assistant system designed to answer inquiries about products available for purchase in an electronic store. The system employs techniques such as Moderation, Prompt Injection Prevention, Classification, Output Checking, and more.
