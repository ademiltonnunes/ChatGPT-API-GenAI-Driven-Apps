# Machine Learning Content
This project aims to implement a customer support system using ChatGPT to
build a web-based system that can answer questions about a website. We are
using as a basis the tutorial available on the open website: OpenAI document -
Website Q&A with Embeddings.
In order to increase learning, I will be documenting the development process
in a few steps, which will be the development of the system on Jupyter Notebook,
Python on Ubuntu and Web Service based and Python Flask.
