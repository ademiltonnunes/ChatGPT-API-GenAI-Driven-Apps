# Keyword and Semantic Searches with ReRank
## Overview
This project exemplifies the use of Rerank technology to improve the results of key search and semantic search. To do this project,

Through this exploration, this aims to uncover insights into how Rerank technology contributes to the improvement of information
retrieval, particularly in the realms of key search and semantic search.
